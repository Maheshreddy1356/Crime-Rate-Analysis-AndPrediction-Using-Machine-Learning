 Crime analysis and prediction is a systematic approach for identifying the crimes.This system can predict region which have high probability for crime occurances and visualize crime prone area.Using the concept of data mining we can extaract previously unknown,useful information from an unstructured data.The extraction of new information is predicted using the exsisting datasets.Here the approach of highest accuracy of the Machine learning algorithm is taken as the preference to perform the pridiction and analysis of crime rates.so,The Random forest algorithm got highest acuuracy upto 96%,This project mainly classified in to six modules which Data gathering module,Data preprocessing module,Feature Selection Module,Building and TrainingModule,Prediction Module and Visualization module.I got so much knowledge on Machine learning Techniques by doing this project.
